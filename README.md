# SDCard-Interface-STM32
***
## Objective:
- [ ] Implement SPI communications
- [ ] Interface the micro-SD card with the MCU through I/O pins.
- [ ] Store the output as an Excel sheet or txt file in the micro-SD card for data analysis.

## Technologies:
* General Purpose I/O
* SPI Library

## Hardware and Equipment:

1. [STM32 Nucleo-FE446RE Micro-Controller Unit (MCU)](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f446re.html) - Equipped with the ARM Cortex M4 processor
2. [SparkFun's Micro-SD Card Breakout*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/544)
