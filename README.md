# SDCard-Interface-STM32
***
## Objective:
- [ ] Implement SDIO communications
- [ ] Interface the micro-SD card with the MCU for storage capabilities.
- [ ] Store the output as an Excel sheet or txt file in the micro-SD card for data analysis.

## Technologies:
* General Purpose I/O (GPIO)
* SDIO communication protocol

## Hardware and Equipment:

1. [STM32 Nucleo-FE446RE Micro-Controller Unit (MCU)](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f446re.html) - Equipped with the ARM Cortex M4 processor
2. [Adafruit's Micro-SD Card Breakout for SD SPI or SDIO*](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4682)
